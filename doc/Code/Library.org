    * =mallocDataH=
      | dataArray | Malloc |
  + the values that are null will be set from outside when the node
    is instantiated.
    * Data will be **Allocad**
    * Port Location is shown to be **malloc** above by =mainPort=
      \dots =Auxiliary4=. However in the future we may **alloca** a value
      to store here
    * NodePtr is **mallocd** in the same way this node is, and thus
      is external
- Notably PortLocation, NodePtr, and Data are not allocated here,
  but are instead sent in.
- Currently =defineMainPort=, =defineAuxiliary1= \dots
  =defineAuxiliary4= malloc the first four ports, and this is what
  link sets for the nodes.
  + This has some trade offs, namely we don't have to alloca more
    ports, however this will lead to waste if say =auxiliary4= is
    never used.
  + In the future this should turn to an alloca, and thus to
    dealloc a node, we need not iterate over i.
- For deallocation, just deallocate the node pointer itself
  + Currently, node pointers are allocated when nodes are made, and
    so are not the responsibility of a node to deallocate all the
    pointers.
    * this however is up to the Net representation themselves, and
      thus should modify the default deallocate node functionality

******* Contract <<Michelson/Contract>>
This module provides a default contract environment
******* Optimisation
- This is a simple optimization strategy which replaces sequences of
  Michelson instructions with equivalent sequences of fewer
  instructions.
  + At the moment nontrivial programs are unlikely to compile to
    the smallest equivalent Michelson instruction sequence,
- but little time has been spent on optimization so far - a high
  degree should be possible; the Haskell typesystem provides very
  strong guarantees.
  + A more interesting / potentially more effective strategy might
    be to search the space of equivalent Michelson programs,
    which at small program sizes using bounded heuristic search
    should be computationally feasible -
    then choose the one with the fewest instructions (or based on
    some other gas-estimation preference function).

******** VirtualStack
- Serves as a virtual stack over Michelson
- This stack has a few properties
  + The values on this stack may or may not be on the real
    stack. However for convention this should be largely ignored,
    except when you wish to do an operation like pair
    * This can be fixed in the future
    * Until then, one should filter out the virtual stack items
- We keep virtual items on the ="stack"= as that makes the details
  on whether something is constant propagation or not act
  consistently with each other.
  + After all, what may not be a constant now, may be in the
    future, or vice versa!

******** InstructionsEff
- This module includes a higher level DSL which each instruction
  has a stack effect
  + This is similar to the base LLVM bindings we have.
  + So for example, emitting an =add=, eats two items from the
    virtual stack, and adds an =Instr.Add= instruction to the
    sequence of instructions to execute
- For constant progoation, have a function say take-2 that looks at
  the top two items in the stack and then returns back either if
  they were constants or not and dispatches logic based on that

- FreeVars is an algorithm that checks for free symbols in the AST.

      let our-point  = {x = 3, y = 4} in

  #+END_SRC
  + here we need to dismiss =our-point.x= and =our-point.y=, just
    filtering out =our-point= isn't enough! we have to check if the
    first-part of the name has =our-point=, since everything shares
    the same namespace
- TODO :: How do we handle this case?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
    mod Foo where
    let foo (x :: xs) = x + TopLevel.Foo.foo xs
    let foo []        = 0
  #+END_SRC
  + To Handle this, we need to unqualify the foo, and have the
    module handle the symbol allocation
- NOTE :: we assume in =nameifyAdt= which takes effect in the =\\=
  call to =nameifyLetType=, that definitions of constructors before
  this point can't be redefined
  + This means that if we have ordered definitions, we'll silently
    drop the calls to the old constructors.
  + Thus, please redefine the logic there to support such modes
- _Reasons to update_
  1. let's not being recursive
     - we assume lets are recursive, if this changes the code
       has to be updated to account for that'
  2. Language becomes ordered
     - see first note above
  3. Universe or Declaration talk about free variables
     - currently universe is unfinished, and are not
       first class

        deriving (Show, Generic, NFData)
    #+end_src

  + Function now looks like
    #+begin_src haskell
      data Function
        = Func Symbol (NonEmpty (FunctionLike Expression)) (Maybe Signature)
    #+end_src
    * Namely this version adds a signature to upon the previous pass
